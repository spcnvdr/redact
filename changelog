redact (0.6.1); urgency=low;
  * Changed error messages to be more helpful and verbose.
  * Changed the wipe_* functions to return void and exit on unrecoverable
    error.
  * Fixed a bug in that caused the program to exit prematurely due to a
    misplaced call to exit().

redact (0.6.0); urgency=low;
  * Added a function to generate temporary file names in the same directory
    as a given log file.
  * Changed the way that temporary files are created. Temporary files are
    now created with random names.
  * Changed several functions to take the log file as a parameter instead
    of relying on the pre-processor defines.

redact (0.5.2); urgency=low;
  * Added additional error checking.
  * Cleaned up comments in the code.
  * Fixed a bug in wipe_fail which printed out incorrect information when
    verbose mode is enabled.
  * Fixed a bug in wipe_auth() that caused some log entries to not be wiped
  * Changed the name of the args structure member acct to acctlog to
    make the naming of args members more consistent.

  * Fixed an error in the wipe_last() where it failed to wipe every
    matching entry in the lastlog file.
  * Fixed a bug in wipe_last() that wiped every lastlog entry when using
    the -i option which wipes all entries that were made from a specific
    host.
  * Fixed an off-by-one bug in wipe_last() in which it printed the wrong
    number of records found when in verbose mode and a host specified.
  * Added error checking to fputs() calls.

redact (0.5.0); urgency=low;
  * Changed several functions, so that if an unrecoverable error occurs
    while wiping a log file, we delete all temporary files created during
    the process. This ensures that if an error occurs, we do not leave any
    temporary log files hanging around that were in the process of being
    redacted.
  * Removed unnecessary variables to decrease stack usage in functions.
  * Added an option to wipe the btmp log file which logs failed
    authentication attempts.
  * Added an option and function to wipe the auth.log log file by removing
    all entries that contain the given username or the user's UID. The
    auth.log file contains system authorization information.
  * Updated the README.md file.

redact (0.4.0); urgency=low;
  * Added a function to wipe systems's process accounting log file.
  * Added verbose output for all the functions that wipe files.

redact (0.3.1); urgency=low;
  * Changed the names of several functions to use a more consistent pattern
    of function names throughout the program.
  * Fixed a logic error where the condition could never be true.
  * Changed the get_userid() function to put the user ID in one
    of the arguments and return an integer indicating if an error occurred.

redact (0.3.0); urgency=low;
  * Added a function and command line option to wipe the faillog log file.
    The only way to wipe this log file is by username, so if the host
    command-line option is used, it will be ignored by this function.
  -- Bryan Hawkins <spcnvdrr@protonmail.com> Thu, 15 Feb 2018 20:57:17 -0600

redact (0.2.0); urgency=low;
  * Added new command line options and changed program to allow the user
    to specify which log files should be modified at run time.
  * Remove reliance on the UT_HOSTSIZE and UT_NAMESIZE constants as not
    every operating system provides them, and this is not their original
    purpose.
  * Removed the preprocessor defines that allowed compilation on FreeBSD
    as there is a lot of work to make the program run on both FreeBSD and
    Linux. This feature will be re-implemented at a later date.
  * Modified the wipe_utmp function so that a single function (wipe_utmp)
    is used to wipe multiple log files (wtmp, utmp, btmp) provided they
    use the utmp data structure.

  -- Bryan Hawkins <spcnvdrr@protonmail.com> Tue, 13 Feb 2018 15:13:37 -0600

redact (0.1.0); urgency=medium:
  * Added several #ifdef statements to hopefully enable this program to
    successfully compile and run on FreeBSD systems. In 2010, FreeBSD
    removed utmp.h and related data structures and replaced them with
    utmpx.h and struct utmpx data structures.

redact (0.0.2); urgency=low:
  * Added a function to remove log entries from the lastlog log file that
    match either a given user name or host IP address.
  * Fixed a bug in the wipe_utmp() function that failed to replace the old
    log file with the new one. This occurred on Linux because the utmp log
    is located in /run which is a tmpfs partition and rename fails when
    moving files between partitions. To fix, we simply change directories
    before creating the temporary file and change back to our old working
    directory when finished. An alternative would be to use the system()
    function and rely on the system's mv command to replace utmp.
